5. Summary of experience: 

John Usher is a humble (ish) pioneer of spatial audio enhancement algorithms for earphones and loudspeakers. He holds a B.Eng. in Electro-Acoustics from the University of Salford and a Ph.D. from McGill University, where he was advised by such Masters as: Dr. W.L. Martens; Prof. W. Woszczyk; Dr. J. Benesty and Prof. A. Bregman. 
The Ph.D. introduced and characterised a new loudspeaker audio upmixing system, further developed for multichannel cinema audio at IMM sound, and now part of Dolby Atmos (patent #8,335,330).

Dr Usher has conducted research at the acoustics department of Bang and Olufsen, the Audio DSP group at Philips Nat Lab, and has given talks at Google-X, University of Cambridge, McGill University, and NASA.

John is an expert and pioneer in the field of Hearables: wearable electronic devices relating to sound. 
In 2006 he joined a new company designing and building smart Hearables. At Techiya (originally Personics, then Techiya), he spent over 10 years conjuring a new earphone for hearing enhancement, augmented reality, hearing protection (dosimetry), music listening and voice communications: it was, arguably, the worlds first smart consumer earphone.

John then co-founded a loudspeaker company. He engineered an all-carbon fibre high-end active loudspeaker. The design used a novel waveguide to direct sound towards a listening position, reducing colouration from room effects. The sound experience was commended by illustrious industry critics and musicians.

He now works in the audio group at Synaptics, engineering next-generation telecommunications systems using classical DSP and the latest ML systems. 

He is a keen tinkerer of electronics projects using Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
