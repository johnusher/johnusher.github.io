please make the website style vibrant, colorful and lively but formal. Correct any typo or grammatical mistakes.
All images (including thumbnails) should be no larger than 1/3 of the screen.
1. title is "John Usher's Homepage". Put this in the center in large black Courier font. The text should text highlighted with color blue. Behind the text is this image: https://github.com/johnusher/johnusher.github.io/blob/main/images/drjhon_banner.png?raw=true
Beneath this title, on a new line, in smaller font, put this text summary in italics (include quote marks): ">20 years experience creating amazing new audio technologies" (put this font also in white font, with text highlighted with color blue.)
2. below put my email address: "yesjhon-at-gmail.com" with a hyper-linnk to the email address yesjhon-at-gmail.com
3. link to linkedin page: https://www.linkedin.com/in/drjohnusher/ (put an arrow going left to right  before the text to show it is a link)

5. Experience: 

John Usher is a humble (ish) pioneer of spatial audio enhancement algorithms for earphones and loudspeakers. He holds a B.Eng. in Electro-Acoustics from the University of Salford and a Ph.D. from McGill University, where he was advised by such Masters as: Dr. W.L. Martens; Prof. W. Woszczyk; Dr. J. Benesty and Prof. A. Bregman. 
The Ph.D. introduced and characterised a new loudspeaker audio upmixing system, further developed for multichannel cinema audio at IMM sound, and now part of Dolby Atmos (patent #8,335,330).

Dr Usher has conducted research at the acoustics department of Bang and Olufsen, the Audio DSP group at Philips Nat Lab, and has given talks at Google-X, University of Cambridge, McGill University, and NASA.

John is an expert and pioneer in the field of Hearables: wearable electronic devices relating to sound. 
In 2006 he joined a new company designing and building smart Hearables. At Techiya (originally Personics, then Techiya), he spent over 10 years conjuring a new earphone for hearing enhancement, augmented reality, hearing protection (dosimetry), music listening and voice communications: it was, arguably, the worlds first smart consumer earphone.

John then co-founded a loudspeaker company. He engineered an all-carbon fibre high-end active loudspeaker. The design used a novel waveguide to direct sound towards a listening position, reducing colouration from room effects. The sound experience was commended by illustrious industry critics and musicians.

He now works in the audio group at Synaptics, engineering next-generation telecommunications systems using classical DSP and the latest ML systems. 

He is a keen tinkerer of electronics projects using Arduino and Raspberry Pi.
